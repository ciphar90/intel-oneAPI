## A Brief of the Prototype:
  The Objective of the protoype ois to enhance quality of medical image processingalgorithms by leveraging SYCL's capabilities to efficiently paralleize and optimize the computation. This can lead to better feature extraction, noise reduction and improved segmentation ultimatey resulting in higher diagnostic accuracy
  
## Tech Stack: 
   Intel OneAPI Base Toolkit, Intel devCloud, SYCl, Intel Advisor for performance comparison
   
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  1. analyze the medical imaging algorithm. Begin by understandint he medical imaging algorithm to be optimized including its input data processing step and expected output.
  2. Identify parallelization of oppurtinites- examine the algorithm to find component that can be executed in parallel. Determine the dependancies between these components to parallelize them efficiently.
  3. Select the target device
  4. Develop a high level design
  5. Implement SYCL kernel
  6. Optimize memory usage
  
## What I Learned:
   Biggest learning for me has been understanding and implementing SYCL using Intel OneAPi which has impacted in much better parallelization and optimized usage of memories.
